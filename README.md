# Class Tracker 
ClassTracker is An Application to Track Class Attendances Using Bluetooth-Low-Energy. This project was done with my team for Computer Science M117 Computer Network in Physical Layer at UCLA. We had successfully developed a working prototype, while there are still many more features we could implement. 

## Abstract/Motivation
- Student feedback is key to improving quality of instruction
- Currently, feedback is mainly provided by end of quarter surveys
- Electronic attendance tracking provides statistical feedback, how attendance varies over the quarter, and incentive for students to attend class
- Using Bluetooth beacons simplifies attendance tracking because they are easy to set up and low maintenance


## Functions Implemented
- Derive currently ongoing lecture period using unique beacon ID, and date/time
- Communicate with backend to update student attendance
- Format backend database to store student IDs, course schedule, and student attendance

## Future Improvements
- Instructor iPhone app
- Additional classroom interactions
- Location within classroom and position based polling
- Combining of multiple classrooms
